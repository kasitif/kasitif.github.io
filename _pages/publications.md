## Ongoing Research

### PhD Thesis (Expected 2026)
**Title**: Detecting and monitoring floods using satellite radar and drone data

This research develops novel methodologies for flood extent mapping using polarimetric SAR data from multiple sensors (Sentinel-1, ALOS-2, UAVSAR). The work includes field validation with drone technology and integration with machine learning for automated flood detection.
