## Introduction

I am a PhD researcher at the University of Stirling, specializing in developing innovative Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) methodologies for flood mapping and environmental monitoring. With over eight years of experience spanning research, operational hydrology, and community engagement across East Africa, I bridge cutting-edge remote sensing technology with practical applications for disaster risk reduction and environmental management.

My work is funded by the UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) and focuses on leveraging polarimetric SAR data from satellites like Sentinel-1, ALOS-2, and UAVSAR, combined with drone technology and machine learning, to detect and monitor floods in near-real-time. I am committed to translating research into actionable solutions that protect communities and support evidence-based environmental policy.

## Academic Journey

My academic journey began with a BSc in Earth Science from Maseno University, Kenya, where I developed a strong foundation in environmental sciences and geospatial analysis. This led to a fully-funded African Union scholarship for my MSc in Water Science (Policy and Governance) at Pan-African University in Algeria, where I explored the intersection of water resources management, policy, and technology.

Currently pursuing my PhD at the University of Stirling, my research focuses on developing novel methodologies for detecting and monitoring floods using satellite radar and drone data. My thesis investigates how polarimetric decomposition techniques can improve flood extent mapping accuracy, particularly in complex environments like vegetated floodplains and urban areas. I have presented my work at leading international conferences including IGARSS, EUSAR, and InGARSS, and published in IEEE journals.

Through my PhD, I have also completed specialized training including the IEEE GRSS PolSAR School 2024 and the ESA/DLR PolInSAR Course, enhancing my technical expertise in advanced radar remote sensing techniques.

## Professional Experience

Before embarking on my doctoral studies, I spent three years as an Assistant Hydrologist at SERVIR Eastern and Southern Africa, a joint initiative of USAID and NASA. There, I led the development of operational hydrological models for Tanzania and implemented community-based flood early warning systems (CBFEWS) across four East African countries. This experience taught me the importance of stakeholder engagement, capacity building, and designing solutions that are technically sound yet accessible to non-technical users.

I have also worked extensively as a consultant, partnering with organizations including UNDP Malawi, the Ministry of Water and Sanitation in Malawi, SNV Kenya, and Climate Action Callander in Scotland. These projects have ranged from establishing flood early warning systems to conducting water quality assessments and flood resilience reviews.

Currently, I am undertaking a placement with the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA), where I am designing deep learning models that integrate real-time social media data for disaster response. This work represents an exciting frontier in combining traditional earth observation with crowdsourced information for rapid impact assessment.

My earlier career included five years as a Junior Hydrologist at Hydrosan Limited in Kenya, where I conducted hydrological and hydrogeological assessments for over 300 water points, developed catchment management plans, and led environmental impact assessments.

## Research Focus

My research sits at the nexus of remote sensing, hydrology, and machine learning. I am particularly interested in:

- **Polarimetric SAR for Flood Mapping**: Exploiting the full polarimetric information from radar sensors to distinguish water from other land cover types, even under challenging conditions like dense vegetation or urban structures.

- **Machine Learning for Environmental Monitoring**: Developing deep learning architectures that can process large volumes of satellite imagery for automated flood detection, damage assessment, and environmental change detection.

- **Community-Based Early Warning Systems**: Translating complex geospatial data into simple, actionable information that empowers local communities to prepare for and respond to floods.

- **Operational Hydrological Modeling**: Building real-time streamflow prediction systems that integrate multiple data sources including satellite precipitation, soil moisture, and terrain analysis.

I am passionate about open science and reproducible research, regularly sharing code and methodologies through GitHub and contributing to capacity building initiatives in East Africa.

## Impact and Vision

Throughout my career, I have maintained a strong commitment to research that creates tangible impact. Whether developing operational flood monitoring systems in Tanzania, training community members in Malawi on early warning protocols, or collaborating with SEPA on cutting-edge disaster response tools, I strive to ensure that my work serves society.

Looking forward, I envision a future where advanced earth observation technologies are democratized and accessible to vulnerable communities worldwide. By combining satellite remote sensing, drone technology, machine learning, and local knowledge, we can build more resilient societies that are better prepared for environmental hazards.
