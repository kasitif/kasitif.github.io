A showcase of my research projects, operational systems, and technical contributions to environmental monitoring and disaster risk reduction.

## Active Research Projects

### Polarimetric SAR for Flood Mapping (PhD Research)
**Institution:** University of Stirling | **Funding:** NERC  
**Duration:** 2022 – 2026

Developing novel methodologies for flood extent mapping using polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. This research exploits full polarimetric information from satellites like ALOS-2 and UAVSAR to improve flood detection accuracy in complex environments including vegetated floodplains, urban areas, and wetlands.

**Research Highlights:**
- Novel polarimetric decomposition techniques for water detection
- Multi-sensor fusion approach combining Sentinel-1, ALOS-2, and UAVSAR
- Field validation campaigns with drone imagery
- Machine learning integration for automated flood mapping
- Operational framework development in collaboration with SEPA

**Outputs:** 3 conference papers, 1 journal article, open-source processing tools

### Social Media for Disaster Response (SEPA Placement)
**Institution:** Scottish Environment Protection Agency  
**Duration:** February 2025 – July 2025

Designing deep learning models that integrate real-time social media data (Twitter/X, Facebook) with traditional earth observation for rapid disaster impact assessment. The system extracts geotagged posts related to floods, droughts, and storms to provide near-real-time situational awareness for emergency responders.

**Technical Components:**
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) for event detection
- Computer vision for image classification and damage assessment
- Geospatial analysis for impact mapping
- Real-time data pipelines with automated alerts
- Integration with SEPA's operational flood forecasting system

### Water Hyacinth Monitoring in Lake Victoria
**Institution:** University of Stirling  
**Duration:** 2022 – 2024

Developed a polarimetric SAR-based methodology for monitoring invasive water hyacinth in Lake Victoria. This work addresses a critical environmental challenge affecting 30+ million people who depend on the lake for livelihoods, demonstrating how radar remote sensing can support ecosystem management.

**Key Achievements:**
- First application of quad-pol SAR for water hyacinth detection
- Temporal analysis showing seasonal infestation patterns
- Published in IEEE JSTARS (Q1 journal)
- Collaboration with Kenya Marine and Fisheries Research Institute
- Presented at IGARSS, EUSAR, and InGARSS conferences

**Impact:** Supporting regional efforts to control water hyacinth spread and protect Lake Victoria's ecosystem.

## Operational Systems

### Tanzania Streamflow Monitoring System
**Organization:** SERVIR Eastern & Southern Africa  
**Duration:** 2019 – 2022 (Operational since 2021)  
**Website:** [streamflowmonitor.rcmrd.org](http://streamflowmonitor.rcmrd.org/)

Led the development of Tanzania's first operational streamflow monitoring and forecasting system. The platform provides real-time and forecasted streamflow for over 50 major rivers, supporting water resources management, hydropower operations, and flood early warning.

**System Features:**
- Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) hydrological model
- Integration of satellite precipitation (GPM, CHIRPS)
- 5-day streamflow forecasts with skill assessment
- Interactive web-based visualization dashboard
- Automated daily processing and dissemination
- API for integration with external systems

**Impact:** Used by Tanzania's Ministry of Water for hydropower planning and flood warnings, serving 1000+ monthly users.

### Rapid Flood Damage Assessment - Western Kenya
**Organization:** SERVIR Eastern & Southern Africa  
**Duration:** 2020

Conducted rapid flood damage assessment following catastrophic flooding in Western Kenya using Google Earth Engine and satellite imagery. The analysis quantified impacts on agriculture, infrastructure, and settlements to support emergency response and recovery planning.

**Methodology:**
- Sentinel-1 SAR for flood extent mapping
- Sentinel-2 optical imagery for damage classification
- Google Earth Engine cloud processing
- Integration with population and infrastructure datasets
- Rapid turnaround (48-hour analysis cycle)

**Impact:** Informed humanitarian response reaching 15,000+ affected households.

## Capacity Building Projects

### Regional Training on Hydrological Modeling
**Organization:** SERVIR Eastern & Southern Africa  
**Duration:** 2019 – 2022

Designed and delivered technical training workshops on hydrological modeling, flood forecasting, and GIS for government agencies across East Africa. Trained over 150 technical staff from Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, and Ethiopia.

**Training Topics:**
- Hydrological modeling with SWAT and VIC
- Google Earth Engine for water resources monitoring
- Community-based flood early warning systems
- Hydraulic modeling with HEC-RAS
- Python for geospatial data processing
