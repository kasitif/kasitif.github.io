Over the years, I have provided technical expertise to governments, international organizations, and NGOs across East Africa and Scotland, specializing in flood early warning systems, water resources management, and geospatial analysis.

## Current Projects

### Community-Based Flood Early Warning Systems
**Client:** Ministry of Water and Sanitation, Malawi  
**Duration:** 2023 – Ongoing

Leading the establishment of community-based flood early warning systems (CBFEWS) across multiple districts in Malawi. This project involves designing technical infrastructure, training local communities, developing Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), and establishing monitoring networks.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Installation of automatic weather stations and river gauges
- Community training on flood monitoring and response protocols
- Development of early warning dissemination channels
- Integration with national disaster management systems

**Impact:** Protecting over 50,000 residents in flood-prone areas through timely warnings and preparedness activities.

## Completed Projects

### Flood Resilience Review for River Teith
**Client:** Climate Action Callander  
**Duration:** 2023  
**Location:** Callander, Scotland

Conducted a comprehensive flood resilience assessment for the River Teith catchment. The study combined hydrological modeling, geospatial analysis, and stakeholder engagement to identify flood risks and recommend nature-based solutions.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Flood hazard mapping using hydraulic models
- Assessment of natural flood management opportunities
- Community consultation and vulnerability assessment
- Recommendations for green infrastructure interventions

**Impact:** Informed local climate adaptation strategy and secured funding for nature-based flood management projects.

### Community-Based Flood Early Warning Systems Implementation
**Client:** United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Malawi  
**Duration:** 2020 – 2022

Implemented comprehensive community-based flood early warning systems in four districts of Malawi. This multi-year project established sustainable frameworks for flood monitoring, community preparedness, and disaster response coordination.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Established 15 community flood monitoring committees
- Installed rainfall and water level monitoring equipment
- Developed mobile-based alert dissemination system
- Trained 200+ community volunteers on flood monitoring protocols
- Created district-level coordination mechanisms with government agencies

**Impact:** Reduced flood-related casualties by 40% in project areas through improved early warning lead times.

### Water Quality and Quantity Mapping
**Client:** SNV Netherlands Development Organisation  
**Duration:** 2021  
**Location:** Laikipia, Isiolo, and Samburu Counties, Kenya

Conducted comprehensive water resources assessment in three arid and semi-arid counties of Kenya. The project combined field sampling, remote sensing analysis, and GIS mapping to assess water availability and quality for pastoral communities.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Baseline water quality assessment (physical, chemical, bacteriological parameters)
- Mapping of water points and seasonal water availability
- Analysis of water demand patterns across pastoral communities
- Recommendations for sustainable water resources management
- Interactive web-based water resources atlas

**Impact:** Informed targeted interventions for water security in 50+ pastoral settlements.
