# About Me

I am a doctoral researcher at the University of Stirling, specializing in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) applications for environmental monitoring. My research focuses on developing novel methodologies for flood mapping and wetland monitoring using polarimetric radar data.

## Research Focus

My PhD work, funded by the UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC), explores innovative approaches to detecting and monitoring floods using:

- **Satellite Radar Data**: Sentinel-1, ALOS-2, UAVSAR
- **Drone Technology**: High-resolution UAV imagery for ground validation
- **Machine Learning**: Deep learning models for automated flood detection
- **Field Validation**: Ground-truth data collection in flood-prone areas

## Professional Background

Before starting my PhD, I spent three years as an Assistant Hydrologist at SERVIR Eastern and Southern Africa, where I led the development of operational hydrological models and implemented community-based flood early warning systems across four countries in East Africa.

## Research Impact

My work aims to bridge the gap between cutting-edge remote sensing technology and practical applications for disaster risk reduction. I collaborate with organizations like the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) to ensure my research translates into operational systems that can save lives and protect communities.

## Current Projects

### SEPA Placement (2025)
Designing deep learning models that integrate real-time social media data for disaster response, focusing on floods, droughts, and storms.

### Water Hyacinth Monitoring
Developing SAR-based methodologies to track the spread of invasive water hyacinth in Lake Victoria, supporting environmental management efforts.

### Community-Based Early Warning Systems
Working with the Malawi Ministry of Water and Sanitation to establish flood early warning systems that empower local communities.

## Publications & Presentations

I have published in leading journals including IEEE JSTARS and presented at international conferences such as IGARSS, EUSAR, and InGARSS. My work has been featured in collaboration with researchers from Africa, Europe, and North America.

## Get in Touch

I'm always interested in:
- Research collaborations
- Consulting opportunities in hydrology and remote sensing
- Speaking engagements
- Capacity building and training
